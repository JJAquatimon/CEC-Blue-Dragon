# Fix Options Menu Visibility Issue

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Identify the CSS issue causing options menu to always be visible
- [x] Fix conflicting display properties in #optionsMenu CSS rule
- [ ] Verify the fix works correctly

## Issue Details:
- The #optionsMenu CSS rule has both `display: none;` and `display: flex;` properties
- The `display: flex;` was overriding the intended `display: none;` default state
- This caused the options menu to always be visible regardless of JavaScript control

## Solution:
Remove the duplicate `display: flex;` property from the #optionsMenu CSS rule, keeping only `display: none;` as the default state. The JavaScript will handle showing the menu when the options button is clicked.
